# LevelEditor
A currently bad level editor made in C++. It was made for me to be able to create levels for upcoming games. I have big plans for this editor to make it stand out but as you can see in it's current state is barley useable but feel free to contribute, anything helps even just grammer/spelling fixes. 

# Todo
* A better readme.md
* Optimize code
* Error handeling
* Move parts of code to functions to keep main.cpp clean
* Move all menus to their own files
* Boxes to get input for gridHeight and gridWidth
* Export levels
* Cleanup function
* Fix known bugs
* Better texture loading with custom names and more than ten textures
